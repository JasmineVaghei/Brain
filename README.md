# Title
Brain Computer Interface Project (Statistics and Classification)

# Contents
Contains experiment design plus functions and classes for a step by step automated statistical analysis and classification of brain signals. 

The step by step procedure includes:
1- Loading data to the Python platform.
2- Preprocessing, which includes data cleaning.
3- Statistical analysis and feature extraction in both time and frequency domains.
4- Classification of data using deep neural networks and Monte Carlo cross validation.

# Data 
Data for this project was collected by myself from human participants using LiveAmp amplifier and acti-Cap EEG system from Brain Products, Germany.
